        <h4 className="mb-3 pb-3">What is BTU?</h4>
        <p className="ac-calculation">
          What is a BTU? The British Thermal Unit, or BTU, is an energy unit. It
          is approximately the energy needed to heat one pound of water by 1
          degree Fahrenheit. 1 BTU = 1,055 joules, 252 calories, 0.293
          watt-hours, or the energy released by burning one match. 1 watt is
          approximately 3.412 BTU per hour.
        </p>
        <p className="ac-calculation">
          BTU is often used as a point of reference for comparing different
          fuels. Even though they're physical commodities and are quantified
          accordingly, such as by volume or barrels, they can be converted to
          BTUs depending on the energy or heat content inherent in each
          quantity. BTU as a unit of measurement is more useful than physical
          quantity because of fuel's intrinsic value as an energy source. This
          allows many different commodities with intrinsic energy properties,
          such as natural gas and oil, to be compared and contrasted.
        </p>
        <p className="ac-calculation">
          BTU can also be used pragmatically as a point of reference for the
          amount of heat that an appliance generates; the higher the BTU rating
          of an appliance, the greater the heating capacity. As for air
          conditioning in homes, even though ACs are meant to cool homes, BTUs
          on the technical label refer to how much heat the air conditioner can
          remove from their respective surrounding air..

          Air conditioners come in a range of sizes, designed to cool different
          volumes of air. The rating of an air conditioner is measured in BTUs,
          and you need to know how many BTUs will be required to cool your room.
          Above is a chart which will tell you the BTUs required for different
          sizes of rooms. Simply work out how big your room is (measure the
          length of your room and multiply it by the width) and then you will
          know roughly how many BTUs your air conditioner requires.

          What is air conditioning, and how does it work?

        <p className="ac-conditioning">
          Air conditioning is a system that helps to regulate the temperature
          and humidity in a space. Air conditioners work by circulating air in a
          room and removing warm air and moisture. This exchange process also
          helps filter out pollutants, dust, and other allergens from the air.
        </p>
        <p className="ac-conditioning">
          Air conditioners come in many different shapes and sizes, but the most
          common type is the central air conditioner. Central air conditioners
          are usually located in a home's basement or crawl space and use
          ductwork to distribute cool air. There are many benefits to air
          conditioning, but some of the most notable include improved air
          quality.

        <h4 className="mb-4 ">Air conditioning good and bad sides?</h4>
        <p className="ac-conditioning">
          Installing air conditioning in your property has both good and bad
          sides. The good side is that air conditioning can improve air quality
          by circulating and filtering air. This can be beneficial for people
          with allergies or respiratory problems.
        </p>
        <p className="ac-conditioning">
          Air condition can also help keep your home cool during hot weather,
          which can be a relief from the heat. The bad side of air condition is
          that it can increase your energy bills. Air condition also produces
          noise, which can be annoying for some people. If you're considering
          air conditioning for your home, weigh the pros and cons to decide if
          it's right for you

          How to maintain air conditioner for the optimal perfomance?
        </h4>
        <p className="ac-conditioning">
          To keep your air conditioner in good shape and running efficiently,
          it's essential to perform regular maintenance. Clean or replace the
          air filter according to the manufacturer's instructions, or an even
          better option is to call the professionals
        </p>
        <p className="ac-conditioning">
          This will help to ensure that air can flow freely through the unit.
          Inspect and Clean the coils regularly to prevent dirt and dust from
          building up. Coils that are dirty or blocked can cause the air
          conditioner to work harder, leading to higher energy bills. ClimaTek
          checks for leaks and seal any cracks or holes that you find. These
          leaks can let air escape from the air conditioner, making it less
          efficient. Lastly, make sure that the air conditioner is installed
          correctly according to the manufacturer's instructions. This will help
          to ensure that it works as efficiently as possible.
        </p>
        <p className="ac-conditioning">
          While air condition has both good and bad sides, the pros may outweigh
          the cons for many people. You can keep your air conditioner in good
          shape and running efficiently by performing regular maintenance.
          However, we have your back if you're low on time or want to leave that
          to professionals.

        <p className="ac-conditioning">
          One of the most common air conditioner problems is that it doesn't
          cool the house evenly. This can be caused by various factors, such as
          dirty air filters, leaky ductwork, or an incorrect thermostat setting.
          To solve this problem, start by checking the air filter and replacing
          it if it's dirty. Next, check for leaks in the ductwork and seal any.
          Finally, ensure that the thermostat is set to "cool" and set the
          temperature correctly.
        </p>
        <p className="ac-conditioning">
          Another common air conditioner problem is that it cycles on and off
          too frequently. This can be caused by various factors, such as a dirty
          air filter, a thermostat that's not set correctly, or a refrigerant
          leak. To solve this problem, start by checking the air filter and
          replacing it if it's dirty. Next, ensure that the thermostat is set to
          "cool" and correctly set the temperature. Finally, check for leaks in
          the refrigerant line and have a professional repair any that you find.
        </p>
        <p className="ac-conditioning">
          If your air conditioner has problems, start by checking the air filter
          and replacing it if it's dirty. If that doesn't solve the problem,
          check for leaks in the ductwork or refrigerant line. Finally, make
          sure that the thermostat is set correctly. If you're still having
          problems, contact a professional for help.
